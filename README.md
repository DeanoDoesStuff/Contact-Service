•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By writing solid unit tests is a surefire way to ensure that software functions perform as intended. Each function is thoroughly tested individually. Zooming out a bit, integration testing checks the interoperability between different functions to ensure the flow between them works as intended. System testing is then used to identify any flaws to the system all together. Finally, security testing tools may be used to identify vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection to prevent security breaches.
•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
•	How do I approach designing software?
When interpreting user needs, I break each requirement down into separate pieces, until each requirement is simplified down to the smallest and most simple terms possible. Then I begin the iterative process of integrating each piece into the program as units and write a test for that unit.
